# Teacher scheduling with PuLP

This is an example notebook on how to solve the teacher scheduling problem with Linear Programming in Python using PuLP. Different algorithms to follow.

STATUS: **WIP**

Currently running into some issues when trying to only get the solutions to show one class for a teacher assigned to an available time slot. Need to play around with the constraints to get this working.
